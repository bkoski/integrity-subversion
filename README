= integrity-subversion

SVN support is {in the works}[http://integrity.lighthouseapp.com/projects/14308/tickets/58-svn-support#ticket-58-13]
for Integrity[http://integrityapp.com], but in the meantime copiousfreetime built SVN support into a {branch on github}[http://github.com/copiousfreetime/integrity/tree/svn].

I took Jeremey's patch and rolled it into a gem to make installation into an existing copy
of Integrity a snap.

Just install the gem:

  sudo gem install bkoski-integrity-subversion --source http://gems.github.com
  
and then add

  require 'integrity_subversion'
  
to Integrity's config.ru (after the rubygems require, of course...).
